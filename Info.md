# General Information

This file is to serve as a basic source of information for others to see and view to hopefully answer any questions people may have if others are offline or unable to help at the moment.

## About

This is a custom event hosting site. Whilst discussing options with the client, they don't want to use calendy or another hoster directly because they want to be able to customize how the calendar looks. As a result, we will be buiding a website that works in the same way but allows us to customize its themes, colors, and content. In return for our voluntary work, we are given laxed deadlines and creative freedom in addition to making our own hours meaning those with 40hr workweeks can relax and not stress on this.

## Specifics

- Theme is nightclub/DJ based so think party floor, lights, and dark colors like deep blue and black with some areas of high contrast.
- We make our own deadlines but we still need to comunicate with the client as good developers.
- We have almost complete creative freedom, our only non-negotiable is that the calendar utilizes its own page, takes up most of the screen, and its not all white meaining easy on the eyes and still in line with our theme.
- Our work is owned by the client BUT we are good to leave our signatures in the code and point other developers and prospective hireables to us. We can make a page dedicated to ourselves but it should remain as a secondary and not found within the main nav bar as the users are there to book events, the average person isn't looking for us.
- The landing page will consist of a cool nightclub overlayed gby a column of nav points and snippets of what you can find or expect. Images used are requested to alternate between left and right.
